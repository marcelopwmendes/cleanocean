# Clean Ocean
Simple educational game that teaches kids to recycle and the importance to do it on a 'race against the time' (as we are right now) to save our planet, with a few obstacles.
<br>
The goal here is to pick up all the trash on the beach (some trashes fly) and recycle before the time runs out. <br>
<br>
Move using W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), D (Right). <br>
The Crab can stun you for a while making you go in randomly directions. <br>
The Shell is hidding in the sand, and if you step on it, it will slows you down. <br>
<br>

Let's clean everybody !
